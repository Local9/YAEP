# No Emojis Policy

**Do not add emojis** to any code, comments, documentation, commit messages, workflow files, or any other project files unless the user explicitly requests them.

## Guidelines

- Code should be professional and emoji-free
- Comments should be clear and text-only
- Documentation should not include emojis
- Error messages and log output should be plain text
- GitHub Actions workflows should not include emojis
- Release notes and changelogs should be emoji-free unless requested

## Examples

```yaml
# ❌ BAD
$verdict = "✅ Clean ($harmless/$total engines found no threats)"
$vtSection = "## 🔒 Security Scan`n`n..."

# ✅ GOOD
$verdict = "Clean ($harmless/$total engines found no threats)"
$vtSection = "## Security Scan`n`n..."
```

```csharp
// ❌ BAD
// ✅ This method validates user input

// ✅ GOOD
// This method validates user input
```

If the user explicitly asks for emojis in a specific context, then and only then should they be added.
