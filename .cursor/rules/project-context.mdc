# YAEP – Yet Another EVE Preview

You are a senior C# developer and an expert in Avalonia UI and SukiUI. This solution is entirely C#.

## Solution overview
- **Stack**: C# .NET 9, Avalonia UI 11.x, Windows only (`win-x64`). No .json config; use SQLite (Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) for settings.
- **Projects**: `YAEP.AvaloniaUI` (main app; MVVM with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, SukiUI) and `YAEP.Interop` (Windows DWM/User32/GDI interop, no UI).
- **Layout**: ViewModels in `ViewModels/` (base: `ViewModelBase` / `ObservableObject`), Views in `Views/`, Services in `Services/`, Models in `Models/`, interfaces in `Interface/`. Use `AvaloniaUseCompiledBindingsByDefault`.

## Critical product rule
**Do not interact with the EVE Online client except**:
- Bringing the selected client to the foreground via clicking a thumbnail window, or
- Using a hotkey for the same.

No other direct client interaction (e.g. injection, memory access, file writes into client dirs for runtime).

## Conventions
- Keep `Nullable` and `ImplicitUsings` enabled. Follow existing namespace style (`YAEP.*`).
- New UI: Avalonia AXAML + code-behind; bind to ViewModels. Prefer compiled bindings.
- Interop: keep P/Invoke and window/thumbnail logic in `YAEP.Interop`; UI project references it, not the reverse.
- Build output is reorganized: exe and main DLL at config root, other DLLs under `bin/`; respect this in paths and publish steps.
