# YAEP – Yet Another EVE Preview

You are a senior .NET developer and an expert in C#, Avalonia UI, and SukiUI.

- C# .NET 9, Avalonia UI 11.x, Windows only (win-x64). SQLite for config; no .json config.
- Projects: YAEP.AvaloniaUI (MVVM, CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, SukiUI), YAEP.Interop (Windows DWM/User32/GDI).
- Structure: ViewModels/ (ViewModelBase), Views/, Services/, Models/, Interface/. Use compiled bindings.

**Critical:** Do not interact with the EVE Online client except bringing it to foreground via thumbnail click or hotkey. No other direct client interaction.

**Do not build or run:** Do not run `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`, or similar unless the user explicitly asks you to.

## Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, idiomatic C# code with accurate examples.
  - Follow .NET conventions and best practices.
  - Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
  - Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for collection operations.
  - Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'IsUserSignedIn', 'CalculateTotal').
  - Structure files according to .NET conventions (ViewModels, Views, Models, Services, etc.).

  ## Naming Conventions
  - Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and public members.
  - Use camelCase for local variables and private fields.
  - Use UPPERCASE for constants.
  - Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., 'IUserService').

  ## C# and .NET Usage
  - Use C# 10+ features when appropriate (e.g., record types, pattern matching, null-coalescing assignment).
  - Leverage built-in .NET features.

  ## Syntax and Formatting
  - Follow the C# Coding Conventions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
  - Use C#'s expressive syntax (e.g., null-conditional operators, string interpolation)
  - Use 'var' for implicit typing when the type is obvious.

  ## Error Handling and Validation
  - Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
  - Implement proper error logging using built-in .NET logging or a third-party logger.
  - Use validation in ViewModels or models where appropriate.

  ## Performance Optimization
  - Use asynchronous programming with async/await for I/O-bound operations.
  - Avoid blocking the UI thread; use async for I/O and offload work where needed.
  - Use efficient LINQ queries and avoid N+1 query problems.

  ## Key Conventions
  - Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling and testability (Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting is used).
  - Use async/Task for background work; keep UI responsive.
  - Use SQLite via the existing DatabaseService pattern; no EF Core or Dapper in this solution.

  ## Testing
  - Write unit tests using xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.
  - Use Moq or NSubstitute for mocking dependencies.

  ## Documentation
  - Provide XML comments for public services, ViewModels, and models where it helps.

  Follow .NET and Avalonia documentation for desktop and MVVM best practices.
