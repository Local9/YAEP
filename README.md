# YAEP - Yet Another EVE Preview

**This will follow the same rules as set out in the others, this will not ever interact directly with the EVE Online client in any way other than bringing the selected client to the foreground via clicking on a thumnail window, or using a hot-key.**

## Well...
Yeap, I know, I know EVE-O-Preview exists, and I know about EVE-X too... but I wanted to learn WPF (because I hate myself, and then started using AvalioniaUI instead). Please do not bug the other projects about this one, this is mostly a personal project which has been made avaliable to others.

My aims? some QoL things...

- Profiles, with hot key switching
  - Allows different executable tracking (default will track exefile of EVE Online)
  - Allows different hotkeys for groups
- Groups, with a GUI to maintain them and add shortcuts
  - Allows you to group thumbnails and set different shortcuts
- No more .json config file, sqlite is just meant for this
  - Got tired of manually editing a file
- Grid tooling with support for other screens
  - Personally I like to group my thumbnails together in a grid, let the computer do the maths
  - Groups can be selected so not all thumbnails are affected
- Mumble Links, just helps getting around faster when there are a lot of channels

### Typical hotkeys

| Hotkey                        | Description                |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Right Click on Thumbnail      | Move thumbnail             |
| CTRL+Right Click on Thumbnail | Move all thumbnails        |
| CTRL+Wheel Up                 | Increase size of thumbnail |
| CTRL+Wheel Down               | Decrease size of thumbnail |
