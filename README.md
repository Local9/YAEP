# YAEP - Yet Another EVE Preview

**This will follow the same rules as set out in the others, this will not ever interact directly with the EVE Online client in any way other than bringing the selected client to the foreground via clicking on a thumbnail window, or using a hot-key.**

## Well...
First things first I should be honest, a glorified slop tool has been used to assist with development as I have a lot on with my actual work life, and I know EVE-O-Preview and EVE-X exists... but I wanted to learn WPF (because I hate myself and it wasn't a fun experience, and then started using AvalioniaUI instead).

My personal aims? just some QoL things...

- Profiles, with hot key switching
  - Allows different executable tracking (default will track exefile of EVE Online)
  - Allows different hotkeys for groups
- Groups, with a GUI to maintain them and add shortcuts
  - Allows you to group thumbnails and set different shortcuts
- No more .json config file, sqlite is just meant for this
  - Got tired of manually editing a file
- Grid tooling with support for other screens
  - Personally I like to group my thumbnails together in a grid, let the computer do the maths
  - Groups can be selected so not all thumbnails are affected
- Mumble Links, just helps getting around faster when there are a lot of channels

Feature suggestions are welcome but will be reviewed before approval, this is mostly a personal project. The slop foundations of what I wanted are now considered complete.
