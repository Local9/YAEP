# YAEP - Yet Another EVE Preview

Yeap, I know, I know EVE-O-Preview exists, and I know about EVE-X too... but I wanted to learn WPF (because I hate myself), and work on some QoL features, yes I could of also forked and worked on that code base, and I did... but it became a quick mess (tabs and spaces, and the general code layout bugged me). So, we're here.

No need bugging the other projects about this one, this is mostly a personal project but being made avaliable to others.

Aims, are to provide functionality that others do, with some QoL (Honestly EVE-O-Preview team, I would be happy to see these added to your project).

- Profiles, with hot key switching
- Groups, with a GUI to maintain them
- No more .json config file, sqlite is just meant for this
- Grid tooling

Honestly, why this isn't something in R.I.F.T. already bemuses me.

**This will follow the same rules as set out in the others, this will not ever interact with the EVE Online client in any way other than bringing the selected client to the foreground via clicking on a thumnail window, or using a hot-key.**
